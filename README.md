# Startpage of Suffering

This is a custom startpage based on [fluidity](https://github.com/PrettyCoffee/fluidity), that has a whole bunch of custom add-ons, configuration files, etc.

### Custom Configuration File

in ./static/js/config.js, there is a file that lets you customize the name on screen, your city (for weather purposes), your birthday, timezone, on-screen quick links, colors, and even your format for the layout entirely if you don't like it!

### Passwords
In the default link selection:
Go to /dev/help, then go to the bottom left and see "login to your thoughts", you see a password box

There are three passwords that you can use by default, and if you have a little bit of code knowledge, you can go into the ~/help/password.html file and make some of your own (it's really easy, just look in the <script></script> tag)

They are:

 - 'mypantsareonfire': takes you back to ~/index.html.
 - 'notebooknotebooknotebook': takes you to a secret notebook, which is saved on refresh, that you can sort-of use as a diary of your choosing.
 - 'password': takes you to a secret image.

If something's broken, don't hesitate to open an issue on github, or dm me on discord if something's taking too long (@mypantsareonfire).

Cheers!
